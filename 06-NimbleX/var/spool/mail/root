   Hello,

   Thank you for giving NimbleX a try. I hope you enjoy it at some extent.
   I know it's far from being good enought for most people but since it's
   a project handled in my spare time you can also contribute to make it
   better. The ways I can think of in which you can help are:

   - spread the word (more users could benefit in many ways.)
   - donate (Donations could help dedicate more time and are good for moral)
   - code (There are a lot of things that need to be done. eg. installer)
   - report bugs and suggest fixes
   - send me a quick email telling me what you'd like to see in NimbleX

   Last but not least check out http://www.nimblex.net to see if you can do
   more with NimbleX. Perhaps the manual and forum should be checked out.

   Regards,
   Bogdan
